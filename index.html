          <h3>About Me</h3>
           <p>Hi, thank you for looking at my portfolio. I'm excited you that you stopped by. My name is Niki Garner. I'm currently a student at <a href="www.epicodus.com/"><strong>Epicodus</strong></a>. I'm learning how to make great websites for people like you. I hope to make a career as a front end developer.

           Before I began my journey as a student of web developement, I worked in retail and office administration. I also when to college and earned a Bachelors degree in Art History.

           My current job isn't related to my field of study or even creavitivly stimulating. Things where fine for a while until I relized my life was stagnet. I needed a career that was satisfying and something that wasn't just a <em>job</em>. Through the suggestion of my borhter I began to take free online coding classes. After the first hour of learning and writing code I was hooked! My mind felt challanged and stimulated. On the quest for more knowledge about coding I found <strong>Epicodus</strong> and I'm so happy to be here.

           When I'm not in class or at work I like to do many things.</p>
